xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".

git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-dejagnu.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-glibc.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc.git

下载依赖

sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev -y
编译

cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
sudo make
运行gdb

make qemu
在另一个窗口下运行

riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb kernel/kernel
gdb打开以后输入

(gdb) target remote localhost:26000
输出类似以下内容则成功，可以开始调试了
